### Name: MAMTHA I
### Reg no: 212222230076

## Aim:
To apply UX research and usability evaluation techniques to analyze a selected application, identify user problems, propose design improvements, and document the findings using a structured UX workflow.

## Algorithm:
### 1.Identify Target Application / Problem Area

Choose a mobile or web application with usability issues.

### 2.Define User Problems

Identify user pain points through observation or feedback.

Write UX problem statements using the template:
“[User] needs a way to [goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact].”

### 3.Select Research Methods

Choose suitable methods such as surveys, interviews, usability testing, or card sorting.

Justify why each method is required.

### 4.Create User Personas

Develop 1–2 personas based on target users.

Include: demographics, goals, motivations, behaviors, and pain points.

### 5.Design Low-Fidelity Prototype (Optional)

Sketch the improved UI screens using wireframes.

### 6.Conduct Usability Test (If applicable)

Ask users to perform tasks on the existing or proposed interface.

Record time, errors, comments, and success rate.

### 7.Analyze Findings

Identify major usability issues.

Prioritize them (High / Medium / Low).

### 8.Propose UX Improvements

Suggest UI changes such as layout, navigation, wording, or interaction updates.

### 9.Document Output

Summarize research findings, personas, problem statements, observations, and recommendations.
